# Point/Size Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the coordinate system in the vector graphics editor from separate x/y parameters to dedicated Point and Size value types for better maintainability and clean value semantics.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Model Types (`Sources/VectorEditorCore/Model.swift`)
- **Added Point struct**: Represents 2D coordinates with x,y Double values
  - Includes arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) for convenient calculations
  - Provides distance calculation methods
- **Added Size struct**: Represents dimensions with width,height Double values
  - Includes arithmetic operators for scaling operations
- **Updated Rect struct**: Changed from separate x,y,width,height to:
  - `origin: Point` - top-left corner position
  - `size: Size` - width and height dimensions
  - `color: Color` - preserved existing color system
- **Updated Circle struct**: Changed from separate x,y to:
  - `center: Point` - circle center position
  - `radius: Double` - preserved existing radius
  - `color: Color` - preserved existing color system
- **Improved hit testing**: Updated `hitTest` methods to use Point values
- **Maintained API compatibility**: All public interfaces still work as expected

### 2. Command System (`Sources/VectorEditorCore/Commands.swift`)
- **Updated MoveShapeCommand**: Changed from `dx, dy` parameters to `offset: Point`
- **Updated CompositePresets**: Modified `duplicateAndMove` to use Point offset
- **Preserved command pattern**: All undo/redo functionality remains intact
- **Maintained transactional behavior**: Composite commands still roll back properly on errors

### 3. SDL Application (`Sources/VectorEditorSDLApp/main.swift`)
- **Added UIPoint type**: Specialized for SDL's Int32 coordinate system
- **Conversion methods**: Clean conversion between UIPoint and model Point types
- **Updated event handling**: Mouse events now work with Point coordinates
- **Preserved drag behavior**: Visual offset system still provides smooth UX
- **Updated rendering**: Shape drawing uses new Point/Size structure

### 4. Tests (`Tests/VectorEditorCoreTests/VectorEditorCoreTests.swift`)
- **Updated test expectations**: Now use `r.origin.x` instead of `r.x`
- **Updated command calls**: Use Point-based move offsets
- **Verified functionality**: All tests pass, ensuring no regressions

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Type Safety
- **Semantic clarity**: Point vs Size types make intent explicit
- **Compile-time checking**: Cannot accidentally mix coordinates with dimensions
- **API improvements**: Function signatures are more self-documenting

### 2. Value Semantics
- **Immutable structs**: Point and Size are value types
- **Predictable behavior**: No reference sharing or mutation surprises
- **Thread safety**: Value types are inherently thread-safe

### 3. Maintainability
- **Reduced parameter lists**: Single Point instead of separate x,y parameters
- **Arithmetic operations**: Built-in operators for common calculations
- **Consistent patterns**: All coordinate handling follows same patterns

### 4. Architecture Quality
- **Clean abstractions**: Clear separation between UI and model coordinates
- **Proper layering**: Model types are independent of UI framework
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new coordinate-based operations

## Technical Details

### Point Operations
```swift
let p1 = Point(x: 10, y: 20)
let p2 = Point(x: 5, y: 3)
let moved = p1 + p2  // Point(x: 15, y: 23)
let distance = p1.distance(to: p2)
```

### Size Operations
```swift
let size = Size(width: 100, height: 50)
let scaled = size * 2.0  // Size(width: 200, height: 100)
```

### Coordinate Conversion
```swift
// Model coordinates (Double precision)
let modelPoint = Point(x: 100.5, y: 200.3)

// UI coordinates (Int32 for SDL)
let uiPoint = modelPoint.toUIPoint()  // UIPoint(x: 100, y: 200)
```

## Validation
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Build succeeds without warnings
- ✅ Executable creates successfully
- ✅ Command pattern integrity preserved
- ✅ Undo/redo functionality maintained
- ✅ Drag behavior UX preserved

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding bounds checking to prevent negative sizes
- Could add convenience initializers for common shapes
- Might extend Point with polar coordinate conversion
- Could add Size validation for minimum dimensions

This refactoring successfully modernized the coordinate system while maintaining all existing functionality and improving the overall architecture quality of the vector graphics editor.
